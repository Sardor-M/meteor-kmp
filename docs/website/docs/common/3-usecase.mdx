title: Common UseCase
---

The `CommonUseCase` class represents a common implementation of a use case in a multiplatform environment. It provides a foundation for executing a use case and returning the result as a Flow of `Result<ReturnType>`. It also allows invoking the use case as a function for more concise usage.

```kt
public abstract class CommonUseCase<Param, ReturnType>(
    private val dispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher
) {
    public abstract fun execute(param: Param): Flow<Result<ReturnType>>

    public operator fun invoke(param: Param): Flow<Result<ReturnType>> {
        return execute(param).catch { e ->
            emit(Result.failure(e))
        }.flowOn(dispatcher)
    }
}
```

Subclasses should override the execute function to define the actual business logic of the use case.
