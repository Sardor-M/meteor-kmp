title: Common ViewModel
---

The `CommonViewModel` class serves as a base class for implementing view models in a multiplatform environment.  It provides access to the store, exposes the state and effect as common flows, and allows dispatching wishes/actions to trigger state updates and side effects.

Also, `CommonViewModel` provides additional functionality and lifecycle management specifically designed for common view models in a multiplatform environment.

```kt
public abstract class CommonViewModel<State : Any, Wish : Any, Effect : Any> : ViewModel {

    public constructor() : super()

    public constructor(closeables: List<Closeable>) : super(*closeables.toTypedArray())

    public abstract val store: Store<State, Wish, Effect>

    public fun wish(wish: Wish) {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            store.wish(wish)
        }
    }

    override fun onCleared() {
        super.onCleared()
        store.cancel()
    }
}

```
