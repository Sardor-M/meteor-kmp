Meteor is a simple framework that helps you to create application using the MVI architecture. It provides a robust structure for organizing your code and separating concerns. Additionally, Meteor integrates with Kotlin Coroutine that helps you to write asynchronous and concurrent code.
## Features

- Horizontally-scalable WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
- Modern, full-featured [client SDKs](/references/client-sdks) for JavaScript, React, Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter (React Native and Unity/C# in development)
- Built for production - JWT authentication and [server APIs](/guides/server-api)
- Robust networking & connectivity over UDP, TCP, and built-in [TURN](/deploy#improving-connectivity-with-turn)
- Easy to deploy: pure Go and single binary
- Advanced features like speaker detection, simulcast, selective subscription, and moderation APIs
<!-- - Effortless, customizable recording - use our built-in templates or record your own web UI -->


## Why Meteor?

WebRTC is a powerful protocol that now has ubiquitous support across all major browsers and mobile platforms. However, building apps with it isn't simple; it requires an understanding of core protocol concepts and developers are responsible for complexities like signaling and coordinating connections between peers. As a peer-to-peer protocol, scaling WebRTC to large numbers of peers also becomes challenging.

While hosted solutions like Twilio and Agora exist, they can be costly, have limited flexibility and as proprietary products, create vendor lock-in. Other open source solutions also exist, but they have a steep learning curve and are daunting to customize and deploy.

We set out to build a free and open source implementation of WebRTC rooms that's easily embeddable within any app. LiveKit provides an opinionated, end-to-end real time communications solution with first-party SDKs for all the major software platforms.

## Architecture

Meteor is written in Kotlin. It's made possible by [Pion WebRTC](https://github.com/pion/webrtc), [ion-sfu](https://github.com/pion/ion-sfu), and the amazing community behind them.
