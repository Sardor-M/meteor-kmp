## What is the Meteor?

It provides a robust structure for organizing your code and separating concerns. 
Additionally, `Meteor` integrates with Kotlin Coroutine that helps you to write asynchronous and concurrent code.

## What is the MVI?

`Model-View-Intent` is an architectural pattern used in software development, particularly in user interface (UI) design. It is commonly applied in the context of reactive and functional programming paradigms.

The MVI pattern aims to provide a clear separation of concerns and a unidirectional data flow within an application.
